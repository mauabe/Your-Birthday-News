# Your Birthday News

## Give us your birth day, we'll give you the world

This web application use modern Javascript concepts to create a full stack application usig Node.js, MongoDB and React.

You must type your birthday in the format `YYYMMDD`, no spaces, no dashes, no forwardslashes, and the app will call 
The New York Times API and give you five top news on the day you were born. 

The fascinating fact is tahta the archives goes back to 1885. So, you can check the news on the day the Status of Liberty 
was inaugurated, on October 28, 1886 (18861028),or Rosa Parks was born, February 4, 1913(19130204). If you want to know 
more about the news about the Triangle Fire in New York City, on March 25, 1911, you must search for the day after, or 19110326.

This MVP app was created on a web development class, and it was my first own "full-stack" project, and was build in 24 hours. 
So for the original code might have flaws and lots of console-logs. The goal was to build a server, connect to an API, retrieve 
data and store it in a database and display it on the browser. This is the orignal app, the front end is the bare-minimum, as I 
spend most fo my time on the back end. Please forgive any inconsistency, as the code is in need of iteration and refactoring.

Thank you,

Mauricio Feldman-Abe
